I have two main objectives for the Jupyter notebook in this folder:
1_ Practice maching learning, Python visualizations and Python coding.
2_ Use data science, specifically Machine Learning (ML) with Python's skikit-learn pack-
age, to ascertain whether a small semi-opaque glass container found on the island of 
Nikumaroro in 2010, and possibly belonging to Amelia Earhart, and a jar of similar vintage 
in the same size and shape (but not color), found on eBay, can be identified as a contain-
er by an ML model fitted to a 1987 glass database.

The notebook, DatasetPlayground_interactive_SMOTE.ipynb, can be viewed in NBViewer here:
https://nbviewer.org/github/joecerniglia/Glass_ML2/blob/b49fa50a2defef9e1c7ae8dc2e3d9f97a9259520/ML_20th_Century.ipynb

The link will bring you to the mybinder website. The project may take a minute or so
to load as the binder installs required packages and instantiates images. Once the 
link has loaded, perform the following steps to run the code:
1_ Double-click on the notebook file, DatasetPlayground_interactive_SMOTE, in the left 
hand pane.
2_ Click on the double >> at the top of the page to run the code in the notebook.
3_ As you read the notebook, you will encounter interactive exhibits with instructions 
on how to use them. The interactive exhibits provide a way for you to verify some of 
the key points in the presentation, and also potentially to pose and answer your own 
questions about the data.

I support the sentiments expressed by The Turing Way:

Many links to related material and source citations can be found in the notebook 
itself.

I owe what I have learned to date in machine learning to Dr. Jason Brownlee:

My ambition is to add to my knowledge in April 2022 when I take the Machine Learning
course at eCornell as part of the Python 360 certificate program, in which 
I am now enrolled:

I plan to enroll in the eCornell Machine Learning certificate program for 
2023.
