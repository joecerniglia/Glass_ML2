I have two main objectives for the Jupyter notebook in this folder:
1_ Practice maching learning, Python visualizations and Python coding.
2_ Use data science, specifically Machine Learning (ML) with Python's skikit-learn pack-
age, to ascertain whether a small semi-opaque glass container found on the island of 
Nikumaroro in 2010, and possibly belonging to Amelia Earhart, and a jar of similar vintage 
in the same size and shape (but not color), found on eBay, can be identified as a contain-
er by an ML model fitted to a 1987 glass database.

The notebook, ML_20th_Century.ipynb, can be viewed in NBViewer here:

I support the sentiments expressed by The Turing Way:

Many links to related material and source citations can be found in the notebook 
itself.

I owe what I have learned to date in machine learning to Dr. Jason Brownlee:

My ambition is to add to my knowledge in April 2022 when I take the Machine Learning
course at eCornell as part of the Python 360 certificate program, in which 
I am now enrolled:

I plan to enroll in the eCornell Machine Learning certificate program for 
2023.
