# Machine Learning for the 20th century

I have two main objectives for the Jupyter notebook in this folder: <br />
1_ Practice maching learning, Python visualizations and Python coding. <br />
2_ Use data science, specifically Machine Learning (ML) with Python's skikit-learn package, to ascertain whether a small semi-opaque glass container found on the island of Nikumaroro in 2010, and possibly belonging to Amelia Earhart, and a jar of similar vintage in the same size and shape (but not color), found on eBay, can be identified as a container by an ML model fitted to a 1987 glass database. <br />

The notebook, ML_20th_Century.ipynb, can be viewed in NBViewer here:

I support the sentiments expressed by The Turing Way:

Many links to related material and source citations can be found in the notebook 
itself.

I owe what I have learned to date in machine learning to Dr. Jason Brownlee:

My ambition is to add to my knowledge in April 2022 when I take the Machine Learning course at eCornell as part of the Python 360 certificate program, in which I am now enrolled:

Update, December 2022: <br />
The paper has now been published by the Turing Data Institute here: <br />
